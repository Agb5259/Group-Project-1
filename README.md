The phenomenon known as global warming is a significant aspect of climate change. The primary reasons for this warming are:

1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: The burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy and transportation releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO₂) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, creating a "greenhouse effect" that warms the planet.

2. Deforestation: Trees absorb CO₂, and when they are cut down or burned, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect.

3. Agriculture and Livestock: Agricultural practices and livestock farming produce methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O), both potent greenhouse gases. Methane is released during digestion by ruminant animals (such as cows) and from decomposing organic matter in landfills and wetlands. Nitrous oxide is released from fertilizers used in agriculture.

4. Industrial Processes: Certain industrial activities release greenhouse gases directly. For example, the production of cement releases CO₂.

5. Land Use Changes: Changes in land use, such as urbanization and agricultural expansion, can reduce the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide.
